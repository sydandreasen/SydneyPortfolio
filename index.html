              <p>
                From day one, the PayPal team was so welcoming and ready to
                help. It was such a great experience to work for a company who
                truly really practices what they preach. The PayPal team lists,
                and lives by, their

                  >core values</a
                >: Wellness, Inclusion, Collaboration, and Innovation. In 12
                short weeks, I saw many examples of each and every one of these
                values being carried out. Here are just a few examples:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Wellness</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Meetings regularly include a check-up on each other making
                    sure everyone is doing well, and we are reminded to get up
                    from our home office and take breaks, and stay just as
                    active during the day as if there were an office to walk
                    around.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Intern meetups included yoga-inspired stretch sessions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Periodic virtual meetups occurred for inspiration for being
                    active, cooking recipes, and keeping kids active for those
                    teammates who were experiencing the unprecendented times of
                    homeschooling kids while trying to work full time from home.

                    Beyond its own internal community, PayPal has reached out to
                    support inclusion in society by, for example, donating large

                    My entire project was entirely collaborative, working
                    alongside and coordinating with two other interns to build
                    an app from the group up.

                    Interns were given the opportunity to participate in a
                    two-week long event to work with the
                    <a href="https://www.kiva.org/" target="_blank">Kiva</a>
                    merchants paired with PayPal. We discussed problem
                    statements presented by small businesses that were brought
                    about largely due to their transition onto fully online
                    sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to learn
                    about these small businesses, brainstorm with them about
                    ideas to improve their business. After getting on the same
                    page with our merchant, our small groups of interns
                    developer proposals for the merchants to dive deeper into
                    solutions to their problems. Check out the great small
                    business I worked with, Ostri Studio,

                    Interns, and all teammates, are encouraged to propose ideas
                    for new innovative ideas the company may want to pursue
                    regardless of whether or not that idea falls in that
                    employee's organization or expertise.

                    For my project itself, we were given very basic instructions
                    of what the end product should do or contain, and the
                    managers left a great deal of the design and implementation
                    up to us. This gave us a chance to more critically think
                    about the impact our application would have on the company
                    and develop a fuller understanding, simply because we were
                    left free to design and not given a specific formula to
                    follow.

              <h3>My Work</h3>
              <p>
                I utilized Adobe XD to prototype a UI and then worked in React
                to build an application from the group up alongside two other
                interns. Our app took previous internal reporting methodologies
                and provided a streamlined app that showed data in a more visual
                and easily understandable format, while providing the
                opportunity for users to filter, sort, export, and interact with
                the data in many ways to maximize the personalized value of the
                data presented on the screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project advanced my professional career greatly by learning
                how to build React apps, work with libraries, work with a
                database and make SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE queries,
                and utilizing an Express server during development to allow the
                front and back ends of the application to interact.
                Additionally, this project facilitated my learning of various
                areas that I wanted to learn for personal projects and made the
                list of things to learn feel much easier, especially with all
                the support I had around me. It blows my mind to think about how
                much I learned and absorbed over those 12 weeks, much of which
                has become second nature. My improvement was evident throughout
                the internship and especially from beginning to end as I write
                this section into my Portfolio site, and just the idea that I
                wrote this whole site with essentially two files, one .html and
                one .css, seems crazy now!
              </p>
              <h3>The Intern Program</h3>
              <p>
                Even being entirely virtual this summer, the University Programs
                Team did a great job of organizing some great events for us
                interns. And the virtual experience was an advantage in many
                ways, connecting us to people from all over the nation and
                world, rather than being focused on networking within just our
                local office. The team organized many business and executive
                speaker events where we had the opportunity to learn more about
                PayPal and receive advice from many successful individuals.
                Other meetings focused on soft skill building, like how to pitch
                a proposal and how to show promote yourself on LinkedIn. Interns
                across the nation met up each week for updates and bonding
                activities. One-on-one intern meetups were also facilitated each
                week to allow more personal interactions with our colleages near
                and far. Besides organizing many opportunities for us to
                network, learn, and build our skillsets, the University Programs
                Team offered incentives to attend and engage in events, which we
                could rack up toward earning prizes. Additionally, the team sent
                all interns a fantastic swag package for interns to show off
                their PayPal gear and experience.

                After looking at short excerpts about each faculty's research,
                the team that spoke to me the most was that of Dr. Brian Knarr,
                which I began volunteering for. Dr. Knarr was interested in my
                potential after little time together and decided to offer me a
                job! As of January 2019, I have been a hard-working and
                dependable undergraduate student research assistant on Dr.
                Knarr's research team. I am always excited to get experience
                working on different projects; when students join the team, they
                tend to notice that I work on as many, or more, projects as each
                of the graduate students on the team.
